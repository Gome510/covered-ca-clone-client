## Background
This project aims to demonstrate how to optimize coveredca.com. As far as I can tell, CoveredCA.com is rendered completely on the client (CSR). Much of the site, prior to the user logging-in, is static content that can be built in advance on the server. NextJS has server-side rendering (SSR) built in along with many other optimizations. Therefore, it is my framework of choice for this project.

## Tech Stack
- NextJS
